# Test Coverage for Grid Client Integration

This document describes the test coverage added to prevent "gridClientService is not defined" errors and ensure Grid client is initialized proactively on app mount.

## Issue Background

Previously, users encountered a `"gridClientService is not defined"` error when trying to fetch wallet holdings. This was caused by:
1. Missing import of `gridClientService` in `features/wallet/services/data.ts`
2. Need for better test coverage around module dependencies

## Tests Added

### 1. Unit Tests - Wallet Data Service (`__tests__/unit/WalletDataService.test.ts`)

**Purpose:** Verify that `walletDataService` properly imports and uses `gridClientService`.

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Verifies `gridClientService` is imported in `data.ts`
- ✅ Confirms `gridClientService` is exported from grid module
- ✅ Checks all required methods exist on `gridClientService`
- ✅ Validates `walletDataService` can be imported without errors
- ✅ Ensures `gridClientService.getAccount()` is called in the code
- ✅ Verifies correct module dependency order: `lib -> grid -> wallet`

**Key Tests:**
```typescript
test('should have gridClientService imported in data.ts')
test('should export gridClientService from grid/services')
test('should have all required methods on gridClientService')
test('should be able to import walletDataService without errors')
test('should have gridClientService.getAccount called in data.ts')
test('should maintain correct import order: lib -> grid -> wallet')
```

### 2. Unit Tests - Grid Context Mount Behavior (`__tests__/unit/GridContextMount.test.tsx`)

**Purpose:** Verify that Grid client is initialized proactively on app mount when user is signed in.

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Verifies `useEffect` runs on `user.id` change
- ✅ Confirms `gridClientService.getAccount()` is called on mount
- ✅ Checks state is updated when Grid account exists
- ✅ Validates handling of missing Grid account
- ✅ Ensures `gridClientService` is imported in `GridContext`
- ✅ Verifies proactive (not reactive) initialization strategy
- ✅ Checks `GridProvider` wraps `WalletProvider` in correct order

**Key Tests:**
```typescript
test('should have useEffect that runs on user.id change')
test('should call gridClientService.getAccount() on mount when user exists')
test('should set gridAccount state when account exists')
test('should handle case when no Grid account exists')
test('should import gridClientService in GridContext')
test('should initialize Grid account BEFORE wallet data is fetched')
test('should have WalletContext load after GridContext in _layout.tsx')
```

### 3. Integration Tests - Wallet Grid Integration (`__tests__/integration/wallet-grid-integration.test.ts`)

**Purpose:** End-to-end test verifying wallet holdings flow works correctly with Grid client.

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Verifies `walletDataService` can be imported
- ✅ Confirms `gridClientService` can be imported
- ✅ Tests fetching wallet holdings without "is not defined" error
- ✅ Validates `gridClientService.getAccount()` works
- ✅ Checks error handling when Grid account is not available
- ✅ Ensures helpful error messages on wallet fetch failure
- ✅ Verifies correct module import chain

**Key Tests:**
```typescript
test('should be able to import walletDataService')
test('should be able to import gridClientService')
test('should fetch wallet holdings without "gridClientService is not defined" error')
test('should be able to get Grid account from gridClientService')
test('should handle case when Grid account is not available')
test('should provide helpful error when wallet fetch fails')
test('should have correct import chain: wallet -> grid -> lib')
```

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
bun run test:unit

# Run specific wallet test
bun test __tests__/unit/WalletDataService.test.ts

# Run specific Grid context test
bun test __tests__/unit/GridContextMount.test.tsx

# Run integration test
bun test __tests__/integration/wallet-grid-integration.test.ts
```

## What These Tests Prevent

1. **Missing Import Errors:** Tests fail immediately if `gridClientService` import is removed from `data.ts`
2. **Undefined Service Errors:** Tests verify all required methods exist before they're called
3. **Module Dependency Issues:** Tests ensure correct import order and module structure
4. **Reactive vs Proactive:** Tests document and verify that Grid client is loaded on mount (proactive)
5. **Provider Order:** Tests ensure `GridProvider` wraps `WalletProvider` in the correct order

## Continuous Integration

These tests should be run:
- ✅ On every pull request
- ✅ Before merging to main branch
- ✅ As part of pre-commit hooks (optional)
- ✅ In CI/CD pipeline

## Future Improvements

Consider adding:
- Performance tests for Grid client initialization time
- Mock tests for Grid API failures
- E2E tests for complete wallet -> Grid flow
- Snapshot tests for error messages
