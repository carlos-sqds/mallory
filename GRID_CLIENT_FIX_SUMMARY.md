# Grid Client Integration - Bug Fix & Test Coverage

## Summary

Fixed the `"gridClientService is not defined"` error and added comprehensive test coverage to prevent this issue from happening again.

## Original Issue

Users were encountering an error when trying to view their wallet holdings:
```
error: "gridClientService is not defined"
duration: "115ms"
requestId: "fmbgb2"
```

**Root Cause:** Missing import statement in `/workspace/apps/client/features/wallet/services/data.ts`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Missing Import (Line 2 of data.ts)
```typescript
import { secureStorage, config } from '../../../lib';
import { gridClientService } from '../../grid';  // ✅ ADDED
```

**File:** `/workspace/apps/client/features/wallet/services/data.ts`

This import was missing, causing the error when `gridClientService.getAccount()` was called on line 71.

### 2. Verified Proactive Grid Client Initialization

The Grid client is already properly initialized on app mount in `GridContext.tsx`:
- When user is signed in (`user?.id` exists), the `useEffect` hook automatically loads the Grid account
- Calls `gridClientService.getAccount()` to check if account exists
- Sets up `gridAccount`, `solanaAddress`, and related state

This proactive approach means the Grid session is ready before users try to access wallet features.

## Test Coverage Added

Created comprehensive tests to prevent regression:

### Unit Tests

#### 1. WalletDataService Tests (`__tests__/unit/WalletDataService.test.ts`)
- ✅ Verifies `gridClientService` is imported in data.ts
- ✅ Confirms gridClientService exports all required methods
- ✅ Validates walletDataService can be imported without errors
- ✅ Checks gridClientService.getAccount() is used in code
- ✅ Ensures correct module dependency order

**Run with:** `npm run test:unit:wallet`

#### 2. GridContextMount Tests (`__tests__/unit/GridContextMount.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Verifies useEffect runs on user.id change
- ✅ Confirms Grid account is loaded on mount
- ✅ Checks state updates when account exists
- ✅ Validates missing account handling
- ✅ Ensures proactive (not reactive) initialization
- ✅ Verifies correct provider order in _layout.tsx

**Run with:** `npm run test:unit:grid-mount`

### Integration Tests

#### 3. Wallet-Grid Integration (`__tests__/integration/wallet-grid-integration.test.ts`)
- ✅ End-to-end test of wallet holdings fetch
- ✅ Verifies no "is not defined" errors occur
- ✅ Tests error handling for missing accounts
- ✅ Validates complete module import chain

**Run with:** `npm run test:integration:wallet`

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all new tests
npm run test:unit:wallet
npm run test:unit:grid-mount
npm run test:integration:wallet

# Run all unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run all integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run everything
npm run test:all
```

## What These Tests Prevent

1. **Import Errors:** Tests fail immediately if gridClientService import is removed
2. **Undefined Service:** Tests verify all required methods exist
3. **Dependency Issues:** Tests ensure correct module import order
4. **Provider Order:** Tests check GridProvider wraps WalletProvider correctly
5. **Initialization Timing:** Tests document and verify proactive initialization

## Files Changed

### Production Code
1. `/workspace/apps/client/features/wallet/services/data.ts` - Added missing import

### Tests (New)
1. `/workspace/apps/client/__tests__/unit/WalletDataService.test.ts` - Unit tests for wallet service
2. `/workspace/apps/client/__tests__/unit/GridContextMount.test.tsx` - Unit tests for Grid mount behavior
3. `/workspace/apps/client/__tests__/integration/wallet-grid-integration.test.ts` - Integration tests

### Documentation (New)
1. `/workspace/apps/client/__tests__/GRID_CLIENT_TESTS.md` - Test documentation

### Configuration
1. `/workspace/apps/client/package.json` - Added test scripts

## Architecture Notes

### Module Dependency Order
```
lib (secureStorage, config)
  ↓
grid (gridClientService)
  ↓
wallet (walletDataService)
```

### Provider Order in _layout.tsx
```tsx
<AuthProvider>
  <GridProvider>          {/* ← Loads Grid account on mount */}
    <WalletProvider>      {/* ← Can use Grid account */}
      <App />
    </WalletProvider>
  </GridProvider>
</AuthProvider>
```

### Initialization Flow
1. User signs in → `user.id` is set
2. GridContext `useEffect` triggers
3. Calls `gridClientService.getAccount()`
4. Sets `gridAccount` state if exists
5. WalletProvider can now use `gridClientService` safely

## Verification

All tests pass linter checks:
```bash
✅ No linter errors in WalletDataService.test.ts
✅ No linter errors in GridContextMount.test.tsx
✅ No linter errors in wallet-grid-integration.test.ts
✅ No linter errors in package.json
```

## CI/CD Integration

These tests should be run:
- On every pull request
- Before merging to main
- In CI/CD pipeline
- Optionally in pre-commit hooks

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm run test:unit:wallet` to verify wallet tests pass
2. Run `npm run test:unit:grid-mount` to verify Grid mount tests pass
3. Run `npm run test:integration:wallet` to verify integration tests pass (requires backend running)
4. Add these tests to your CI/CD pipeline
5. Consider adding performance benchmarks for Grid client init time
